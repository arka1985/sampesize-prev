# Sample Size Calculator for Prevalence Studies

A visually stunning, scientifically accurate, and interactive web application for calculating sample sizes in prevalence studies.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Scientific Precision**: Uses the standard formula $N = 4PQ/D^2$ for calculating sample size with 95% confidence.
*   **Dynamic Visualization**:
    *   **Sample Size Curve**: An interactive graph showing how sample size ($N$) changes with prevalence ($P$).
    *   **Incremental Feedback**: A glowing indicator moves along the curve as you adjust parameters.
    *   **High-Contrast Sliders**: Large, vibrant controls designed for visibility and ease of use.
*   **Premium UI**:

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Prevalence (P)**: Use the slider to set the expected proportion of the disease/condition (0-100%).
2.  **Precision (D)**: Adjust the acceptable error margin (1-20%).
3.  **Result**: The required sample size ($N$) is calculated instantly and displayed.

## 🛠️ Technology

*   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
*   **CSS3**: Advanced animations, glassmorphism, and responsive design.
